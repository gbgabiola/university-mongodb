# Lab 4.2: Aggregation Performance

## Problem:
For this lab, you're going to create an index so that the following aggregation query can be executed successfully.

After importing the restaurants dataset, without any indexes:

```
$ mongoimport -d m201 -c restaurants --drop restaurants.json
```

If you attempt to run the following query you'll receive an error.

```
db.restaurants.aggregate([
  { $match: { stars: { $gt: 2 } } },
  { $sort: { stars: 1 } },
  { $group: { _id: "$cuisine", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])
```

```
{
  "ok": 0,
  "errmsg": "Sort exceeded memory limit of 104857600 bytes, but did not opt in to external sorting. Aborting operation. Pass allowDiskUse:true to opt in.",
  "code": 16819,
  "codeName": "Location16819"
}
```

Identify why this error is occuring, and build an index to resolve the issue.

Keep in mind that there might be several indexes that resolve this error, but we're looking for an index as small as possible that services this command.

In the text box below, submit the index that resolves the issue.

For example, if you ran **db.restaurants.createIndex({ foobar: 1 })** to fix the error, then you'd enter **{ foobar: 1 }** into the text box.

Note: The index should be ascending in nature.

## Enter answer here:
